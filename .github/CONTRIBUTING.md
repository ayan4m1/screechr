## Code of Conduct

All contributions to this project are governed by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you're familiar with the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), you already know it. The gist of it is that we have an obligation to limit harassment, hate, and unprofessional behavior in all aspects of the project.

It's a two-way street - respect the time and effort of the developers and they will respect your interest in the project and desire to help it improve.

## Responsibilities

 * Test changes on multiple browsers, and, when possible, operating systems
 * Ensure that all contributions meet minimum standards of security, performance, and quality

## Before opening a PR, make sure that...

 * Your branch is [rebased](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rebase-and-update-a-pull-request) off of `master`
 * No extraneous files have been checked in
 * Your branch does not contain commits unrelated to the feature or fix at hand
 * You have updated the documentation to cover any new or changed options, features, configuration, etc.

This project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and the [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
