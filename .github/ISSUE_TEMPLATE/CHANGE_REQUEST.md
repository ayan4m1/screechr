## Desired behavior

Provide a clear and concise description of the change you'd like to see. It might be helpful to tell a story that starts with a _problem_ with the way things are, has a middle where something _changes_, and an ending where things are _better_. For example:

> As a server operator, I don't have a way of configuring or customizing the bot from the Discord client. This means that I need to know how to use a text editor.

> I would like to add a direct message command `!config` which triggers further configuration options.

> This change would allow us to start adding a Discord-side configuration system to the bot. It is faster and more of a "native" solution than editing a text file and restarting a Node process.
